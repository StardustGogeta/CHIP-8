<h1>Star-C8</h1>
An interpreter for the CHIP-8 virtual machine made by Joseph Weisbecker in the 1970s. This was developed and tested on Ubuntu 14.04 using the fantastic Code::Blocks IDE and GCC as the compiler. This project also was written in the C language, and employs SDL2 and SDL2_mixer for graphics and audio respectively.<br>
The executable file supports command line control in the following format: "./StarC8 tetris.c8". If using this method, place the file "beep.wav" in the same directory as the executable.
